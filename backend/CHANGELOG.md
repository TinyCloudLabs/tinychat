# @tinychat/backend

## 0.2.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 69c76b3: Experimental Conversation Canvas, off by default. Settings → Experimental Features → Conversation Canvas adds a Chat/Canvas switch to each chat. Canvas visualizes branches, lets you continue from an earlier message, and pins versioned Markdown documents into the next request.
  - **Explicit opt-in per chat.** Each chat is switched to Canvas only after you confirm, with a warning about what changes.
  - **One chat history.** The chat history stays the single source every reader uses, including share links, other devices and older app versions. Picking a branch rewrites the chat to that branch, and messages sent elsewhere are folded into Canvas.
  - **Safe concurrent edits.** Edits from other tabs and devices are never overwritten.
  - **No cost when off.** Accounts and chats that never use Canvas never touch Canvas storage.
  - **Permission on enable.** Turning Canvas on asks for its storage permission when the session doesn't have it yet.
  - **Backend manifest.** The backend's app manifest adds the `canvas` SQL permission.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2eecb38: Private cloud transcription API for Exo desktop (`/api/transcriber/private-cloud`), dark by default: `PRIVATE_CLOUD_TRANSCRIPTION_ENABLED` plus an account allowlist gate the routes. The backend creates batch jobs on the private transcription service with an HMAC tenant reference instead of the wallet address, returns a relative upload path with a job-scoped capability (audio goes straight from the desktop to the service), and relays status, results, cancel and delete with stable error codes and correlation ids.

### Patch Changes

- e822748: Expose backendRevision and backendVersion in /api/server-info so deploys can prove the new build is live.
- 5c16fb5: Allow the Exo mobile app's fixed origins (`https://localhost` on Android, `capacitor://localhost` on iOS) in CORS.
