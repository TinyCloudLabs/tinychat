The Google OAuth callback can return to the Exo mobile app. A flow the app starts carries a `native.` tag in its `state`, and for that tag only the callback redirects `{ code, state }` to the app's fixed deep link (`xyz.tinycloud.exo://oauth/google`) instead of posting it to the web origin. States with an unknown tag are refused. Web flows are unchanged, and the registered Google redirect URI stays the same.
