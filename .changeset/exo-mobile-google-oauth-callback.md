The Google OAuth callback can return to the Exo mobile app. A flow the app starts carries a `native.` tag in its `state`, and for that tag only the callback redirects `{ code, state }` to the app's fixed deep link (`xyz.tinycloud.exo://oauth/google`) instead of posting it to the web origin. States with an unknown tag are refused. Web flows are unchanged, and the registered Google redirect URI stays the same. The native return is off unless `GOOGLE_OAUTH_NATIVE_RETURN=true`; while it is off, `native.` states are refused and the callback never redirects a code to the app.
