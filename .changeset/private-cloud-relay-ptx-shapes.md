Private cloud transcription relay: accept PTX batch's actual job and list shapes. PTX reports lifecycle timestamps instead of `updated_at` (the relay now derives `updated_at` from the latest one), reports `retention.audio: "not_received"` before the upload, and lists jobs as `{ object: "list", data }`. Before this, every status poll and list through the relay failed with `upstream_bad_response` against a real PTX.
