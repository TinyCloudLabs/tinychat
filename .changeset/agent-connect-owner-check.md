Connect agent now refuses an OpenKey key that is not the one you are signed in with. An OpenKey account can hold several keys, and each key owns separate TinyCloud spaces. If you picked another key in the Connect agent prompt, the agent was granted access to that key's data instead of your signed-in account's. TinyChat now compares the connected address with the signed-in session address (ignoring checksum casing) and stops before any grant is minted or sent. It shows both shortened addresses and asks you to choose the signed-in key.
