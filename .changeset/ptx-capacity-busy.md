Handle the private transcription service's 429 `capacity_exhausted` (TC-907). Calendar auto-join counts each create attempt once, so its backoff no longer doubles per attempt. An occurrence the service keeps refusing for capacity now ends after its joining window with the outcome "All TinyCloud notetakers were busy when this meeting started." Before, it was polled every 15 minutes indefinitely and never cleaned up. A manual send that hits the cap now shows the service's "All N meeting notetakers are busy…" message instead of the generic "temporarily unavailable" text, and the backend relays `Retry-After` and `retry_after_seconds` on any upstream 429.
