Calendar auto-join sends one bot when two connected accounts auto-join the same Meet (TC-581). The second account sends no bot while the other bot is in the call, and sends its own if that bot leaves within its joining window. It sees a neutral "Already being recorded by another TinyCloud account" state instead of a failure. With `CALENDAR_AUTOJOIN_SHARING` off (the default), that state never promises a transcript. With it on, the second account gets the transcript only if both checks pass: the other account is on its own invite, and its verified Google email accepted the bot owner's own invite. If the other account is not on its own invite, the collision shows as unverified ("an account we couldn't match to your invite") and is never shared. Shared recordings show as "Shared recording" and can be removed from your list, but not ended or deleted. Auto-join now also asks for the `email` scope; existing connections must reconnect before they can be matched or receive a share.
