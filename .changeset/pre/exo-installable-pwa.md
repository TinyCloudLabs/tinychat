Exo on the web is now an installable app (PWA).

- **Install Exo.** Chrome, Edge and Android offer to install tinycloud.chat as "Exo", with its own window and the same icon as the mobile app. On Chromium the page shows an "Install Exo as an app." prompt (hidden once installed, and for 30 days after "Not now"). On iOS, use Share > Add to Home Screen.
- **Opens offline.** The installed app opens without a connection: you get the app and the "You're offline…" screen (with the offline voice recorder), not the browser's error page. Only the app itself is stored on the device. Chats, API calls and sign-in always go to the network and are never cached.
- **Updates.** When a new version is out, Exo shows "New version of Exo available." with Reload. You can ignore it, and the new version loads the next time you open Exo after closing all its tabs.
- The desktop and mobile apps are unchanged. They never use the web app's offline cache.
