Fix the Private transcription length boundary. Eligibility compares the unrounded note length with PTX's limit from `/capabilities`: `accepted_max_duration_seconds` (PTX's inclusive ceiling on measured duration) when present, otherwise `max_duration_seconds` plus the optional `duration_grace_seconds`. The client keeps a 0.25 s margin below the ceiling. Client-built WAVs are rechecked against the greater of the precise saved duration and exact decoded payload duration, and the latest byte cap is checked against the actual payload. Legacy integer durations use a conservative +0.5 s estimate. No Private limit is hard-coded; without a complete duration and byte advertisement Private is not offered. The backend relays the optional duration fields when PTX sends them; a client-only deploy is safe. Clock-style media durations floor fractional seconds consistently for the total and current position, and a refused Private start returns its refusal to the caller.
