Lost private agent access is no longer hidden. When an agent turn runs without private access (no session, an expired or stale grant, or a failed status check), the backend still answers from public tools, but first sends a `delegation_error` frame (`delegation_required`, `delegation_expired` or the new `delegation_unverified`). It also tells the model to send the user to Settings > Agent access to reconnect, not to pick another model. This applies to both the Eliza task path and the legacy loop. The browser shows the Reconnect banner without aborting the public answer, and a failed check reads "Couldn't verify" rather than "expired". The session status read before each turn now times out after 3s; POST and DELETE stay unbounded. Agent grants are minted for 29 days so a fast browser clock cannot trip the 30-day courier ceiling, and Connect errors name the server's code. The meeting tool contract accepts the `exo-local` source.
