# @tinychat/frontend

## 0.4.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 0a273d3: Connect agent now refuses an OpenKey key that is not the one you are signed in with. An OpenKey account can hold several keys, and each key owns separate TinyCloud spaces. If you picked another key in the Connect agent prompt, the agent was granted access to that key's data instead of your signed-in account's. TinyChat now compares the connected address with the signed-in session address (ignoring checksum casing) and stops before any grant is minted or sent. It shows both shortened addresses and asks you to choose the signed-in key.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ae3f67: Exo on the web is now an installable app (PWA).
  - **Install Exo.** Chrome, Edge and Android offer to install tinycloud.chat as "Exo", with its own window and the same icon as the mobile app. On Chromium the page shows an "Install Exo as an app." prompt (hidden once installed, and for 30 days after "Not now"). On iOS, use Share > Add to Home Screen.
  - **Opens offline.** The installed app opens without a connection: you get the app and the "You're offline…" screen (with the offline voice recorder), not the browser's error page. Only the app itself is stored on the device. Chats, API calls and sign-in always go to the network and are never cached.
  - **Updates.** When a new version is out, Exo shows "New version of Exo available." with Reload. You can ignore it, and the new version loads the next time you open Exo after closing all its tabs.
  - The desktop and mobile apps are unchanged. They never use the web app's offline cache.

### Patch Changes

- 96007c1: Lost private agent access is no longer hidden. When an agent turn runs without private access (no session, an expired or stale grant, or a failed status check), the backend still answers from public tools, but first sends a `delegation_error` frame (`delegation_required`, `delegation_expired` or the new `delegation_unverified`). It also tells the model to send the user to Settings > Agent access to reconnect, not to pick another model. This applies to both the Eliza task path and the legacy loop. The browser shows the Reconnect banner without aborting the public answer, and a failed check reads "Couldn't verify" rather than "expired". The session status read before each turn now times out after 3s; POST and DELETE stay unbounded. Agent grants are minted for 29 days so a fast browser clock cannot trip the 30-day courier ceiling, and Connect errors name the server's code. The meeting tool contract accepts the `exo-local` source.
- 1f682a0: Chat replies start streaming without waiting for the user message to be saved to TinyCloud SQL; the save runs alongside the stream and still lands before the reply, and a new chat's first message no longer reads a compaction checkpoint it cannot have. Every thread-store SQL call is now bounded (15s), so a dropped response fails as a retryable error instead of hanging that chat's saves for the rest of the session.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 69c76b3: Experimental Conversation Canvas, off by default. Settings → Experimental Features → Conversation Canvas adds a Chat/Canvas switch to each chat. Canvas visualizes branches, lets you continue from an earlier message, and pins versioned Markdown documents into the next request.
  - **Explicit opt-in per chat.** Each chat is switched to Canvas only after you confirm, with a warning about what changes.
  - **One chat history.** The chat history stays the single source every reader uses, including share links, other devices and older app versions. Picking a branch rewrites the chat to that branch, and messages sent elsewhere are folded into Canvas.
  - **Safe concurrent edits.** Edits from other tabs and devices are never overwritten.
  - **No cost when off.** Accounts and chats that never use Canvas never touch Canvas storage.
  - **Permission on enable.** Turning Canvas on asks for its storage permission when the session doesn't have it yet.
  - **Backend manifest.** The backend's app manifest adds the `canvas` SQL permission.

- fcbdc49: Google Meet and Calendar autojoin can be connected from the Exo mobile app. Google refuses sign-in inside the app's web view, so on mobile "Continue with Google" opens the system browser (Custom Tabs on Android, Safari on iOS) and returns to Exo when you finish. The web app's popup flow is unchanged. The in-app flow ships switched off (build flag `VITE_EXO_NATIVE_GOOGLE_OAUTH`) until it can return through a verified https link; until then the app says that Google can be connected from the web.
- ecc9346: Exo mobile: record voice notes when Exo can't connect, and they are saved once it reconnects.
  - **Record from the offline screen.** If Exo launches without a connection but your session is still held ("You're offline…" or "Can't reach Exo right now. You're still signed in."), that screen now has a voice recorder. It shows the elapsed time, the level and the same microphone warnings as the Voice notes card. Stop keeps the note on the phone, and the screen counts what is waiting: "2 notes will be saved when you're back online." The recorder stays on screen through "Try again". It is not offered when you are signed out, because there is no account to save to.
  - **Saved when the session is back.** Once Exo is signed in again, notes still on the phone (recorded offline, or from a save that failed) are saved to your TinyCloud space right away, without opening Connectors. When private-cloud transcription is on, they are queued for it just like notes saved from the card. This uses the card's own retry, so a note is never uploaded twice.
  - **A recording that is still running carries over.** If Exo reconnects while you are recording, the chat screen's voice note bar shows that recording and its Stop. The recording is never restarted.

- e7a02a2: Exo mobile: record a voice note from the chat screen, and the Google connect dialog stops offering what the app can't do yet.
  - **One-tap voice note.** Inside the native app, the header has a "Voice note" button. One tap starts recording and opens a bar under the header with the elapsed time, the level meter, the same microphone-state warnings as the Voice notes card (the system blocking the mic, no sound arriving) and Stop. The chat stays usable underneath. Stop saves the note to your TinyCloud space, after which the bar offers Open Library. If the save fails, the bar says so and the note stays on the phone. The bar uses the Voice notes card's own recorder, so saved notes appear in Connectors → Sources and Library as before. The button is not shown on Connectors, where the card has its own Record and takes over a recording that is still running. The web and desktop apps are unchanged.
  - **Google connect in the app.** While a build keeps Google sign-in off inside the app, the Google Meet and Calendar autojoin dialogs show the "isn't available in the Exo app yet" explanation and a Close button instead of "Continue with Google". When a build turns it on, the consent text says you sign in "in your browser" instead of "in a popup window". The web and desktop dialogs are unchanged.

- 4e22e2e: Exo mobile voice notes are capped at 60 minutes and stored in parts, so long notes save and play back.
  - **60-minute limit.** The phone's recorder (Android and iOS) stops a note by itself at 60 minutes, the same way Stop does, and the note is saved like any other. The card shows the limit in the last five minutes ("Recording 55:00 of 60:00") and says "Stopped at the 60-minute limit." afterwards. A recording left running can no longer grow to hundreds of megabytes (6 hours was 188 MB).
  - **Stored in 1 MiB parts.** Audio is stored in the user's space as raw parts of at most 1 MiB plus a manifest written last, read from the phone one part at a time. The production node's ingress refuses request bodies over 1 MiB, so the old single base64 value failed for notes longer than about a minute and a half. A save that fails partway leaves the note on the phone, and "Save now" resumes after the parts already stored without writing anything twice.
  - **Playback and transcription read the parts.** The player loads a note part by part (with progress) into an object URL. Notes saved before this change, stored as one value, still play and transcribe.

- f69c62a: Exo mobile voice notes can be transcribed with private cloud transcription (TinyCloud Private Transcription → Tinfoil), the same path as the desktop's Exo Local engine. It is offered only when the build has a PTX upload origin, the device can upload (iOS, or Android 8.0 and later), and the backend admits the account. The user confirms "Use private cloud" once, and the choice is kept per account. New notes are transcribed after they are saved, and older ones have a Transcribe action. The card shows progress, failures with Retry, and the transcript. "Turn off" stops anything not yet sent.

  Transcribed voice notes appear in Library and in meeting chat. A voice note that is not transcribed is not a meeting, so it never wins "my latest meeting". Exo desktop's private cloud recovery no longer adopts a phone's voice-note job: it recovers only jobs it made itself.

### Patch Changes

- d9ba752: Exo mobile: the app opens on chat instead of the marketing page, stays clear of the status bar, notch and gesture bar, and reads properly on phone-width screens.
  - **Opens in the app.** Inside the native app, `/` goes straight to `/chat`, where a signed-out user gets the sign-in screen. The web and desktop apps still open on the landing page.
  - **Safe areas.** The app shell now pads the left and right safe-area insets (landscape notch, side navigation bar) as well as the top one. The agent access prompt and its "Agent tools active." toast sit above the home indicator. Desktop browsers and the desktop app report zero insets, so their layout is unchanged.
  - **Agent access prompt on phones.** Below the `sm` breakpoint the "Connect private agent access" prompt spans the screen with its button under the text. It used to be squeezed into half the width. From `sm` up it is the same centred row as before.
  - **Library titles on phones.** Below `sm`, a meeting or voice-note title gets its own line, with the source chip and date under it, so "Voice note · Sep 29, 1:40 PM" is no longer cut to "Voice note · Sep 29, 1…". From `sm` up the row is unchanged.

## 0.3.0-beta.6

### Minor Changes

- ecc9346: Exo mobile: record voice notes when Exo can't connect, and they are saved once it reconnects.

When a build turns it on, the consent text says you sign in "in your browser" instead of "in a popup window". The web and desktop dialogs are unchanged.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c16fb5: Voice notes for the Exo mobile app: a Voice notes card in Connectors → Sources (shown only inside the native app) records on the phone, saves to your TinyCloud space, plays back, keeps unsaved notes on the device and retries them, and shows when the system blocks the microphone. Voice notes appear in Library.
- e76fcaa: Exo desktop: add the "Private cloud" transcription engine for Local recording (upload a stopped recording to TinyCloud Private Transcription via a native capture handle, poll, and save it as the same Exo Local meeting). The engine is hidden: this build compiles in no private transcription origin.

### Patch Changes

- fb522f4: Exo Local transcripts read naturally: consecutive same-speaker segments merge into turns (max 60 s), speakers are labelled You (mic) and Others (system audio), mic chunks that are wholly an echo of the call audio are dropped, and meeting chat can answer "what did I / what did they say".
- 4542521: Keep the sign-in when Exo launches offline. A session restore that fails because the network or backend is unreachable now keeps the saved session and shows "You're offline. Exo will reconnect when you're back online." instead of signing out; "Try again" (and coming back online) re-runs the restore rather than a full OpenKey sign-in. Expired or invalid sessions still sign out as before.
